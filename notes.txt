Do we want to mark the system calls we modified so we only manipulate their behavior
    Mark modified system calls and dependent system calls

Does strace truncate or modify the it prints as parameters?

Do we only want to replay the system calls up to the point of the mutation?
    It seems like if the rest of the system calls are good, it could mess things up
