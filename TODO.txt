BUG: If there are multi-character literals in strings presented by strace then
write buffer will probably not copy what you want (i.e. '\n' etc.)
Added system call id to posix-omni-parser
    Patch to add the stuff with accept that isn't supported

Don't Forget:
recvfrom
sendto
fcntl

look at setsockopt and getsockopt
getsockopt -> notify when this is called, error out

Get accept working without having to modify traces
    **This is done but it looks like the implementation broke something

Implement select
Expand poll to support more than one data structure
Other system calls for curl, wget
Run things from the netcheck traces -> look at big traces
    We want to support all of the calls that netcheck and checkapi support
Submit patch to posix-omni-parser for picking up poll and select stuff
***Report when the number of reported bytes returned differs from the length of
the string.
    This will be a good unit test

Select vs. Poll
Select used a bitmask rather than an array of structures to track file
descriptors. Select is more commonly implemented but the nature of a bitmask
means that there are a limited number of file descriptors that can be tracked.
It has one advantage over poll: Early versions of poll didn't allow you to set a
structure's file descriptor to -1 to have it ignored meaning that if you no
longer care about a file descriptor you would have to rebuild the array.
Presumably it will be easier to un-track a file descriptor with select.


Use netcat send mode for next test

Send-like calls -> always assume they succeeded and return the expected number
of bytes from the trace.


Write-like system calls:
write
sendmsg
sendmmsg
sendto
send

Read-like system calls:
read
recvmsg
recvmmsg
receivefrom
recv
